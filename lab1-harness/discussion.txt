1.Theoriotically, the unstatic FIRFilter and the static elaborated FIRFilter should compile the same hardware design. But a litter bit difference is found in the generated verilog file.
As to the area and the critical-path(and WNS, TNS, MAX_FREQ etc.):
the unstatic FIRFilter has a bigger area at 6963.082000 and the  static elaborated FIRFilter has 6871.578000 area.
unstatic FIRFilter:
  WNS: 7.622
  AX_FREQ: 420.589
static elaborated FIRFilter:
  WNS: 7.729
  MAX_FREQ: 440.288

2.Definitely the for-loop will make the tap change easier.

3.Just keep the same. But we only use the multiply answer when it is valid.

4.MultiStage FIRFilter:
  Chip area for top module '\mkFIRFilter': 51601.074000
  WNS:7.622 (same as the unstatic one)
  MAX_FREQ: 420.589 (same as the unstatic one)
