1.Theoriotically, the unstatic FIRFilter and the statically elaborated FIRFilter should compile the same hardware design. But a litter bit difference is found in the generated verilog file.
The area and the critical-path(WNS, TNS, MAX_FREQ, etc.) are the same if we do not use any other internal temp regs or variables.

2.Definitely the for-loop will make the tap change easier.

3.Just keep the same. But we only use the multiply answer when it is valid.

4.MultiStage FIRFilter:
  Chip area for top module '\mkFIRFilter': 51601.074000
  WNS: 7.508
  MAX_FREQ: 401.218
