1. Describe your design of the mkPitchAdjust module. How many cycles does it take to do a
single round of pitch adjustment in your design?

A: First the module get the infio's data. Then it repeatedly calculate the new magnitude and phase, set the new complex data to the certain position(bins).
Finally it put the result vector into the outputfifo.
In combinational design, it take less than 1 cycle definitely.
In sequential design, we can choose whether put the deq and enq method in two extra cycles. So the module will take nbins to (nbins+2) cycles according to the design.
In the code it takes (nbins+2) to make the timing slack more comfortable.

2. Describe your design of the ToMP and FromMP modules. How many cycles does it take to convert
a Vector of N Complex numbers to a Vector of N ComplexMP numbers assuming it takes K
cycles to convert a single number?

A: Just put the infifo's data to the Cordic module and get the result when it done, then put the result to the outputfifo.
(N*K+2) cycles because fifo's deq an enq cost 1 cycle.

3. What portion of your time in this lab was spent initially implementing the mkPitchAdjust
module and completing the pipeline, and what portion of your time was spent designing and
implementing tests and debugging the pipeline?

A: tests > design
maybe 3H > 30min

4. Report the synthesis result (i.e., area and critical path) of your mkAudioPipeline module.
The report also shows you where the critical path starts and ends. Can you Figure out which
module accounts for the critical path?

A: Seems that the critical path is in FFT module(Even when we use combinational PitchAdjust).
